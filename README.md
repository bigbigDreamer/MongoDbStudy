## Introduce

&emsp;&emsp;Here I took notes on MongoDB.

## Install

### Download the MongoDB's MSI

#### *Case: You have to put MongoDB on a C drive.[Remember it is must]*

## Configure environment variables

&emsp;&emsp;You need to add MongoDB's `bin` directory to the system variables.

## Verify that the installation was successful

```bash
# You can execute the following command.
 mongo
```
